Python Programmer: Accomplishments and Skills
As I continue my journey as a Python programmer, I've worked on various projects, showcasing my skills in data handling, algorithmic design, and machine learning.

Projects & Skills:
Machine Learning: Industrial Equipment Failure Prediction

Developed Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict industrial equipment failures using the ai4i2020 dataset.
Applied SMOTETomek for data balancing and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
Achieved 65% accuracy with Random Forest and 71% accuracy with XGBoost.
Gained hands-on experience in model evaluation, data preprocessing, and handling imbalanced datasets.
Python Basics & Algorithms

Unit Conversion (Week 1): Implemented a script to convert meters to feet, focusing on precision and variable management.
Mad Libs Game (Week 3): Created a program using string manipulation and user input.
Triangle Area Calculator (Week 5): Engineered a function to calculate triangle areas, applying algorithmic thinking and modular code.
Tipper Program (Week 6): Developed a tip calculator with input validation and function abstraction.
Dice Roller (Week 7): Built a dice roller simulation using loops and random number generation.
Key Competencies:
Problem-Solving: Adaptive approach to different coding challenges.
Code Readability: Focus on clean, well-commented, and modular code.
